## Project Abstract

The MCA Department Management System is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to modernize and streamline the academic and administrative operations of a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) department. Built with a modern technology stack including Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, the application provides a seamless and role-based experience for administrators, faculty, and students.

Key features include dedicated dashboards for each role, enabling efficient management of users, classes, and academic records. Students can access study materials, view their performance, explore placement opportunities, and submit anonymous feedback. A standout feature is the AI-powered feedback summarization tool, which uses Genkit to provide concise, sentiment-analyzed summaries, helping faculty and administration quickly identify areas for improvement. The project demonstrates best practices in modern web development, utilizing Next.js Server Components for performance and ShadCN for a polished, accessible UI.
